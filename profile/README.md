## About BugHerd
BugHerd is a collaborative visual feedback and bug-tracking tool designed specifically for web development projects. It bridges the critical communication gap between non-technical stakeholders (clients, marketers, project managers) and developers by making it incredibly easy to report issues and suggestions in context. Instead of receiving vague emails like "the button is broken on the homepage," developers receive a precise pin on the exact element, complete with a screenshot, comment, and all necessary technical environment details. This eliminates confusion, reduces back-and-forth communication, and dramatically speeds up the review and development cycle.

The tool is implemented as a simple browser sidebar that stakeholders can activate on any website where the BugHerd snippet is installed. This creates a shared, visual workspace where feedback is centralized and actionable. Each pin becomes a task that can be dragged through workflow stages (e.g., "To Do," "In Progress," "Done") on the integrated task board. BugHerd also integrates with popular project management tools like Trello, Jira, Slack, and GitHub, allowing teams to fit it seamlessly into their existing workflows. By making feedback visual, contextual, and structured, BugHerd transforms the often chaotic process of website reviews and QA into a smooth, efficient, and collaborative process for agencies, SaaS companies, and in-house development teams.
